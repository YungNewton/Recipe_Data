# Item 3a:

# In the given code, the issue arises from the way Python handles mutable data types like lists. When you pass the list as an argument to a function in Python, it is passed by reference, not by value.
# This means that if the list is modified within the function, the changes will persist outside of it, which is not always the intended behavior.
# Consider a correct implementation of unpair_at_most as below:

def unpairAtMost(n: int, pairs: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]:
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    else:
        pairs[:n] = [num for pair in pairs[:n] for num in pair]
        return pairs[:2*n]
#Let's consider the test case (2, [(10,20),(30,40),(50,60)]). 
# The unpair_at_most function first changes the pairs list in-place to [10, 20, 30, 40, (50, 60)], and then it returns the first 2*n elements, which are [10, 20, 30, 40]. 
# The problem is, when the model_solution is called next with the same test case, the pairs list is already modified.
# So, the result of model_solution would be different from unpair_at_most, causing checker to return False, even though unpairAtMost is actually correct.
