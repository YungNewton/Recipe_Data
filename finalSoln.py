# Item 3a:

# In the given code, the issue arises from the way Python handles mutable data types like lists. When you pass the list as an argument to a function in Python, it is passed by reference, not by value.
# This means that if the list is modified within the function, the changes will persist outside of it, which is not always the intended behavior.
