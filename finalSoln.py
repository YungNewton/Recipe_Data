# Item 3a:

# In the given code, the issue arises from the way Python handles mutable data types like lists. When you pass the list as an argument to a function in Python, it is passed by reference, not by value.
# This means that if the list is modified within the function, the changes will persist outside of it, which is not always the intended behavior.
# Consider a correct implementation of unpair_at_most as below:

def unpair_at_most(n: int, pairs: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]:
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    else:
        pairs[:n] = [num for pair in pairs[:n] for num in pair]
        return pairs[:2*n]

# Let's consider the test case (2, [(10,20),(30,40),(50,60)]). 
# The unpair_at_most function first changes the pairs list in-place to [10, 20, 30, 40, (50, 60)], and then it returns the first 2*n elements, which are [10, 20, 30, 40]. 
# The problem is, when the model_solution is called next with the same test case, the pairs list is already modified.
# So, the result of model_solution would be different from unpair_at_most, causing checker to return False, even though unpairAtMost is actually correct.
# To be more specific, a runtime error is ecountered,The unpair_at_most function is expected to return a flat list of integers, while the model_solution expects the input to remain a list of tuples.
# So when unpair_at_most modifies the input list in-place, it causes model_solution to crash because it tries to iterate over integers.


# Item 3b: 

# The bug can be fixed by passing a deep copy of the test case to the student_solution and model_solution so any changes they make don't affect each other. 
# Here's the modified checker:


def checker(model_solution: FunctionSignature, student_solution: FunctionSignature, test_cases: list[Input]) -> bool:
    for test_case in test_cases:
        # We use copy.deepcopy to create completely separate copies of the test cases for each function
        student_test_case = copy.deepcopy(test_case)
        model_test_case = copy.deepcopy(test_case)

        student_answer = student_solution(*student_test_case)
        expected_answer = model_solution(*model_test_case)

        if student_answer != expected_answer:
            return False

    return True

# This updated checker function will correctly return True when the student_solution is correct. 
# It's always important to keep Python's argument passing semantics in mind when dealing with mutable types.
