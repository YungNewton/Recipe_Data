        Hey matt this is a practice website i built,<br/> so you apply the css styling methods you learned.
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Use inline Styling to style this page.</h2>
        <p>Make sure all your styles look good.<br/> 
            Remember you can get always get color combinations from <a href="https://colorhunt.co/" target="_blank">colorhunt</a>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Here are some hints and tips to styling this page beautifully.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Remember what a div is ?</h4>
                <p> 
                    In our previous discussion we talked about divs, We said they are used to 'divide' the webpage<br/>
                    Avoid applying background color to individual divs
                    instead apply the color property to the body tag.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Use only one background-color</h4>
                <p>
                    To avoid conflict of colors, use only one background color for the page.<br/>
                    Make sure the one selected is aesthetically pleasing.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Read and Understand the Code</h4>
                <p>
                    Before starting work on any Codebase you must first read and Understand the structure of that codebase.<br/>
                    Similarly, before  applying styles to the code make sure to Understand it's structure.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
